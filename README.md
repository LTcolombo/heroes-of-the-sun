# Heroes of the Sun

**Heroes of the Sun** is a fully on-chain settlement builder and exploration game built on Solana, powered by the Magicblock stack.

You manage a small settlement turn by turn: gathering resources, keeping your workers alive, constructing buildings, and unlocking tech. Every action is stored on-chain. You’ll explore a shared, procedurally generated world, collect loot, and mint **GOLD** — a fungible token you can use to buy resources or trade outside the game.

One of the most interesting mechanics is player-deployed token minters. These are smart objects placed in the world that let other players mint custom tokens using **GOLD** and in-game resources. Pricing is dynamic and driven by a bonding curve, and token metadata is stored on IPFS.
