# Heroes of the Sun

**Heroes of the Sun** is a fully onchain simulation that can't be shut down or tampered with.  
Think **Roblox**, but permissionless and unstoppable. Players establish settlements, create and collect resources, and interact with an ever-evolving world shaped entirely by user-generated actions.

The game begins with familiar resource-management loops — gathering resources, keeping workers alive, constructing buildings, and unlocking tech.  
Players can then venture into a shared, procedurally generated world to explore and engage with a fully open, verifiable platform and economy.

One of the core innovations is **smart objects** — in-game items mapped to newly deployed smart contracts.  
Smart objects allow creators to easily "mod" the game, while players interact with an expanding set of behaviors and resources.  
There are no servers: all game logic is defined through Solana programs.  

Early examples include:
- A **custom token generator** for new resources, using bonding curve pricing (similar to pump.fun)
- An **AI oracle** that simulates a god-like agent, shaping gameplay outcomes
